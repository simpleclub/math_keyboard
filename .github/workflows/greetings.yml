  # Cannot run the greeting job on PRs because the contributors we want to greet will open PRs
  # from their own forks. When creating a PR from a fork, the GitHub Actions associated with that
  # PR will be run from the fork as far as credentials are concerned. The GITHUB_TOKEN secret
  # only has read access in that case and therefore cannot create a PR comment with the greetings
  # message. See:
