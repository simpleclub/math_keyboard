`math_keyboard` is a Flutter package that allows editing math expressions using a typeset text field
(so-called "math field") and a custom-made fully integrated math keyboard in _Flutter only_ - no
plugins, no web views.

## About math_keyboard

The `math_keyboard` package provides a widget that behaves like a Flutter `TextField` with the same
_full integration_, i.e. **focus tree** support, **input decoration** support, and both an
_on-screen software keyboard_ as well as **physical keyboard input** support. On top of that, the
math field typesetting uses TeX and the package supports converting to math expressions (that e.g.
can be used for calculation).

`math_keyboard` is an open source project with the aim of providing a way to edit math expression
providing the best user experience in terms of input and UI as well as allowing accurate evaluation
of the mathematical expressions entered by the user. This is used by the
[simpleclub app][simpleclub], hence, the association. It is also maintained by [simpleclub][]
(see the [`LICENSE`][license] file).

## Usage

See the [package README][package readme] for usage information.

## Missing features

You might notice that some features that you would expect from the `math_keyboard` package are
missing or something is not working as expected. In that case, please [file an issue][issues].

In general, we can of course never fully solve every use case, however, especially in this case we
are aware of a few shortcomings. For example the customization options of the keyboard are currently
limited because this has simply not yet been a requirement in our internal usage. In that case,
please consider **contributing** pull requests to this repo in order to allow as many use cases
to be covered as possible :) See the next section for information on that.

## Contributing

Our mission with open source repositories like `math_keyboard` in particular is creating an
ecosystem of science and education related packages for Flutter, allowing users on all platforms to
use the optimal tools for learning.

This is also why we want to share and collaborate on this software as a way to give back to the
community. Any contributions are more than welcome!
